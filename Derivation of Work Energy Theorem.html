<p>We begin with the integral of $\vec{F}$ which is equal to the work done on the system. Force is integrated with respect to position.</p>

\begin{equation}
    F = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    W = \int\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \cdot d\vec{r}
\end{equation}

The momentum principle is used to substitute the change in momentum over change in time for the net force. 

\begin{equation}
    W = \int m * \frac{d^2{x}}{dt^2} \cdot d\vec{r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    a = \frac{d^2{x}}{dt^2} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = \int m * a \cdot d\vec{r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F = m*a
\end{equation}

The momentum principle is then separated into its mass and acceleration components... with acceleration being brought to the general form of the second derivative of x, with x being position. At present, the integral is consistent with the Second Law. It is apparent that velocity in a non-differential form is needed to arrive at the change in kinetic energy.

\begin{equation}
    a = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = \int m * \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \cdot d\vec{r}
\end{equation}

Acceleration is now represented as its definition: change in velocity over the change in time. 

\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = \int m * \vec{v} \ d\vec{v}
\end{equation}

 Initially, the integral is integrated with respect to position. The $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{t}$ are substituted with the velocity given its definition. There remains a \vec{v} within the integral still. Now, the function is being integrated with respect to velocity. This conceptually remains consistent with the fact that the change in kinetic energy varies by changes in the velocity.

\begin{equation}
    W = m \int  \vec{v} \ d\vec{v}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = \frac{m\vec{v^2}}{2} 
\end{equation}
Once integrated, the kinetic energy formula is reached. When positions are specified for a and b values, the change in kinetic energy will be solved by: 

\begin{equation}
    \Delta K = \frac{m\vec{v_f^2}}{2} - \frac{m\vec{v_i^2}}{2} 
\end{equation}
